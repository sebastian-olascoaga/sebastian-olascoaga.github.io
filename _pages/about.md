I am an [MIT Presidential Fellow](https://web.mit.edu/provost/presfellow/){:target="_blank"} studying a Ph.D. in Urban Economics & Statistics at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/). I began my studies at Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas [(CIDE)](https://www.cide.edu/de/){:target="_blank"}, where I earned a BA in Economics. I decided to get a more profound training in Economics, so I embarked on a journey to earn a Masters in Quantitative Economics at the Paris School of Economics [(PSE)](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/){:target="_blank"} and the École Normale Supérieure [(ENS)](http://www.ens.fr/en){:target="_blank"}.

While pursuing my Master's degree, I worked at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development [(OECD)](http://www.oecd.org/){:target="_blank"}, analyzing the connections between public economics, policy, and health care. During these years, I also worked with Innovations for Poverty Action [(IPA)](https://www.poverty-action.org/){:target="_blank"}, learning how to design and conduct a Randomized Contol Trial. During my Master's degree, I got interested in income inequality and big data, and I decided to write my [thesis](https://sebastian-olascoaga.github.io/files/inequality_mexico_2015.pdf){:target="_blank"} about top incomes in Mexico. Afterward, I decided to work for the government of Mexico at the [Treasury Department](https://www.gob.mx/hacienda){:target="_blank"}. Over there, I was the Director of Economic Policy, where I provided analyses and advice on international and national economic policies, economic and financial risks, and potential public policies to the Chief Economist.

While that was fun, I decided to start my Ph.D. at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/), focusing on topics related to policy analysis, health care, public and labor economics, methods & statistics, and housing.
