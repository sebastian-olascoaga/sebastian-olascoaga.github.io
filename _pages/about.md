I am an [*MIT Presidential Fellow*](https://web.mit.edu/provost/presfellow/){:target="_blank"} studying a Ph.D. in Urban Economics & Statistics at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/). I began my studies at Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas [(CIDE)](https://www.cide.edu/de/){:target="_blank"}, where I earned a BA in Economics. I decided to get a more profound training in Economics, so I embarked on a journey to earn a Masters in Quantitative Economics at the Paris School of Economics [(PSE)](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/){:target="_blank"} and the École Normale Supérieure [(ENS)](http://www.ens.fr/en){:target="_blank"}.

While living in Europe, I worked at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development [(OECD)](http://www.oecd.org/){:target="_blank"}, analyzing the deep connections between public economics and health care. During these years, I also worked with Innovations for Poverty Action [(IPA)](https://www.poverty-action.org/){:target="_blank"}, learning how to conduct and develop a Randomized Contol Trial.
